It's aleady 2020. 

I moved to a new lab space on the survey side as the department is moving as a whole. 
I am sitting in this new lab typing my first *real* blog on this site. 

I should probably to treat this blog slash personal website more seriously, but, meh. 

Some expectations for 2020, as it just starts:

1. Get more papers written. Or just in general, getting more writting done. 
I should probably also revisit the book *How to Write a Lot*. 

2. Find a better balance between research and personal life. 
I felt i've done much better in the previous year. 
Thanks to the important persons in my life.

3. _Be happy_. In every aspect.

And happy new year to anyone who happens to be reading this post. 
And if it's not within the new year range when you are reading this, have a great day, stranger.
